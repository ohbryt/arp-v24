## Notes for Assessors

- TRIPOD 2015 applies to **non-AI/ML prediction models only** (logistic regression, Cox regression, etc.). For AI/ML prediction models, use TRIPOD+AI 2024 instead. Do NOT apply both simultaneously.
- Items 10a, 10b, 14a, 14b, 15a, 15b are specific to **development studies**. Mark as N/A for validation-only studies.
- Items 10c, 10e, 13c, 17, 19a are specific to **validation studies**. Mark as N/A for development-only studies.
- Item 16 must include BOTH discrimination (C-statistic/AUC) and calibration (calibration plot, Hosmer-Lemeshow, or calibration slope/intercept). A study reporting only AUC without calibration assessment is PARTIAL on this item.
- Item 8 (sample size): the events per variable (EPV) ratio should be reported. EPV < 10 should be flagged as a limitation.
- Item 15a (full model specification): the complete regression equation must be presented, not just significant predictors. Omitting non-significant predictors from the final model presentation is a common gap.
- For studies that combine development and validation (e.g., internal-external validation), all items apply.
