Does NOT apply to static/manually programmed rule-based systems or simple decision trees.

**Relationship to STARD 2015:** STARD-AI extends STARD 2015 (Bossuyt et al. BMJ 2015). Of the 40 items, 22 are UNCHANGED from STARD 2015, 4 are MODIFIED, and 14 are NEW. Items are numbered to maintain alignment with STARD 2015 where possible.

**Relationship to other guidelines:**
- CONSORT-AI: for clinical trials of AI interventions
- SPIRIT-AI: for trial protocols involving AI
- TRIPOD+AI: for AI prediction/prognostic models
- CLAIM 2024: for AI/ML in medical imaging
- Use STARD-AI when diagnostic accuracy of an AI system is the primary focus

## Notes for Assessors

### When to Use STARD-AI vs Other AI Guidelines

- **STARD-AI**: When the study evaluates diagnostic accuracy of an AI system as the primary outcome. Includes imaging AI, LLM-based diagnostic tools, pathology AI, EHR-based diagnostic systems.
- **TRIPOD+AI / TRIPOD-LLM**: When the study develops or validates a prediction/prognostic model using AI/ML.
- **CLAIM 2024**: When the study develops or validates an AI model specifically for medical imaging.
- **CONSORT-AI**: When the study is a clinical trial of an AI intervention.
- Authors may refer to multiple checklists and select the one most aligned with the study's primary aim.

### Key Assessment Points

1. **Item 1 (Title)**: The title must explicitly identify the study as reporting AI-centered diagnostic accuracy. Merely mentioning "machine learning" or "deep learning" without connecting it to diagnostic accuracy is PARTIAL.
2. **Item 7 (Eligibility)**: STARD-AI requires eligibility criteria at BOTH participant level (e.g., age, diagnosis) AND data level (e.g., image quality, scanner type). Reporting only participant-level criteria is PARTIAL.
3. **Item 12 (Annotation)**: Must include who annotated, their experience levels and background, and how (within clinical context or post hoc). Missing any of these elements is PARTIAL.
4. **Item 14 (Data acquisition)**: Must describe data acquisition protocols and preprocessing in sufficient detail to allow replication.
5. **Item 23 & 35 (Fairness/Ethics)**: These are paired items — methods/assessment in Item 23, ethical considerations and fairness discussion in Item 35. Both must be present. If the study claims fairness was not assessed, this should be explicitly stated with justification.
6. **Item 25 (Baseline characteristics)**: For AI studies, characteristics must be reported for EACH dataset partition (training, validation, test), not just overall.
7. **Items 39-40b (Other information)**: Commercial interests (39), data/code availability (40a), and audit/evaluation (40b) are NEW and commonly missing. These are increasingly required by journals.

### Relationship to MI-CLEAR-LLM

If the AI system under evaluation is an LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, Gemini), apply MI-CLEAR-LLM (6 items) alongside STARD-AI. MI-CLEAR-LLM addresses LLM-specific concerns (stochasticity, prompt documentation, data contamination) that are not covered by STARD-AI.

### Common Gaps in AI Diagnostic Accuracy Studies

Based on the systematic review that informed STARD-AI development (Aggarwal et al. npj Digit Med 2021):
1. Missing annotation process details
2. Missing data preprocessing description
3. No fairness/bias assessment
4. No external validation or test set representativeness discussion
5. Missing model architecture and training details
6. No commercial interest disclosure
7. No data/code availability statement

## Verification Note

This checklist was verified against the published Table 2 of the STARD-AI paper in Nature Medicine (2025;31:3283-3289, DOI: 10.1038/s41591-025-03953-8). Item numbering, descriptions, and NEW/MODIFIED/UNCHANGED classifications match the published version. Verified 2026-04-11 via Nature Medicine online full-size Table 2 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-025-03953-8/tables/2) and STARD 2015 checklist (EQUATOR Network). The STARD 2015 original checklist (Bossuyt et al. BMJ 2015) was used to confirm UNCHANGED items.
