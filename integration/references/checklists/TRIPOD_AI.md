## Notes for Assessors

- TRIPOD applies to both development and validation studies. Some items (e.g., 10c, 13c, 19a) are specific to validation studies; mark as N/A for development-only studies.
- The AI extension items are mandatory for any study using machine learning or deep learning methods.
- Item 15a (full model specification) is often not feasible for deep learning models; in that case, item 15-AI (model availability) becomes critical.
- Item 16 must include BOTH discrimination and calibration. A study reporting only AUC without calibration assessment is PARTIAL on this item.
- Item 16-AI (fairness) is increasingly expected but may be marked N/A if the study population lacks demographic diversity data, with a note explaining this limitation.
- For studies that are both diagnostic accuracy and prediction model studies, consider cross-referencing with STARD as well.
